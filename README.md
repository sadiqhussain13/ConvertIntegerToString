# ConvertIntegerToString

Now the main motivation behind typing this code was just to convert an Integer to String BUT after execution if you type strings or doubles then it throws a exception of InputMismatchException(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/InputMismatchException.html).

So I used while loop with the condition of if the input is other than an integer it would simply notify me and demand a number without throwing exception(depends on what you type in the println).
The same tactic can be used if the conversion is from String to an Integer.
